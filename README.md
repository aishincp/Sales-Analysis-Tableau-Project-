# SALES ANALYSIS
#### 24 July, 2024

## Overview

This is one of my few data analysis projects showcasing a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard to analyze and visualize sales data to provide key insights or trends of a company’s sales performance and activities. This dashboard demonstrates a clear and concise view of sales metrics between 2020 and 2023 by leveraging the Tableau Public data visualization tool.

## Inspiration
My fascination for data analysis and storytelling arises from a deep interest in how data can unveil information and approach it to make strategic decisions. Having an electronics background and completing a master’s in IT, I started exploring the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), which highlights that the data is crucial to generating valuable insights or to designing optimized models. By employing this project, my enthusiasm helped to uncover insights or patterns that help stakeholders or businesses improve sales strategies.

### __Key Insights & Findings__
*1. Total Sales, Profit & Quantity*: 

The dashboard summarizes total sales, profit, and quantity for the year 2023 compared to the previous year (2022). The visual charts show an increase in total sales of 20.4%, profit of 14.2%, and quantity sold by 26.8%.

*2. Monthly Sales and Profit Trends*:

To visualize this, a line chart illustrates the sales and profit trend over 2023, with notable highlights for the highest and lowest months. This visualization helps to identify seasonal patterns and peak sales performance, as well as profit and quantity performances.

*3. Product Subcategory Performance*: 

A bar chart compares the sales and profit (or loss) for different product categories and sub-categories from 2020 to 2023. This comparison highlights which subcategories are performing well and which are under-performing.

Technical Details
For this project, I have utilized a powerful data visualization tool, Tableau Public, to incorporate several advanced features such as:

Floating containers: to organize the dashboard layout and ensure a clean and structured presentation.

*1. Filters*:  applied filters to refine data and allow for detailed analysis based on selective years, products (such as categories & sub-categories), and location (region, state, and city).

*2. KPIs*: These were designed to visualize overall sales, profit, and quantity performance.

*3. Charts*: A bar chart was designed to compare year-over-year sales and profit. Likewise, a line chart was used to illustrate weekly trends.

### __Purpose__

This dashboard’s sole purpose is to present an overview of sales metrics and trends to analyze year-over-year sales performance and effectively understand the trends inside it. This project is also my second attempt at learning the Tableau tool, allowing me to explore how this tool works. I have gained valuable insights into data analysis by analyzing sales data, specifically including skills like data visualization, KPI development, trend analysis, and creating an interactive dashboard.

### __Insights__

Overall Sales Performance (2023): $ 733K in total sales shows a 20.4% rise over the previous year (PY). $ 93K in total profit, with a 14.2% increase compared to PY. A total of 12K quantity units were sold in all, marking an increase of 26.8% over PY. As indicated in the KPI charts, knowing which months have the highest and lowest sales is essential to understand seasonal trends and plan marketing strategies.
Profitable Subcategories: Phones, Binders, Chairs, Tables, Storage, and Accessories were profitable subcategories. Subcategories that sustained loss or were less profitable were Machines, Appliances, and Bookcases. This comparison makes it easier to see which products are doing well and which require modification or reconsideration.
Weekly Trends: The average weekly sales varied between $ 14K to $ 15K, and there were notable differences between profitable and less profitable weeks, with an average of $ 2K. The weekly or seasonal trend information can guide promotions or discount strategies.

### __Future Improvements__
I plan to expand this project by incorporating another dashboard for customer analysis. This additional dashboard provides deeper insights into customer behavior, such as repetitive orders, and regional sales patterns, that can further enhance the analysis and help to develop targeted sales strategies.
